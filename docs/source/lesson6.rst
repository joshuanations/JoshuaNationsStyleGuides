Lesson 6: Angels and Demons
===========================

I. THE DOCTRINE OF ANGELS
=========================

More than two hundred references in the Bible make it clear that there is an order of celestial being distinct from humanity who occupy an exalted state above the present position of fallen man. They are by definition messengers- heavenly messengers that may appear as humans, who serve as superhuman beings in various ways to fulfill God’s providential concerns to God, the World, and Man.

A. They are mentioned in the Old Testament and the New Testament
1. Genesis 16:7
2. Rev. 22:16
3. Jesus mentions them over twenty times in the Gospels alone.

B. The reality and existence of angels
1. Angels are moral beings created by God, long before the creation of man.
2. They were all created simultaneously according to Col. 1:16
3. Characteristics of angels.
a. Created to glorify and to serve God (Heb. 1:13-14)
b. They are very numerous, immortal, and possibly sexless (or at least
celibate). See Daniel 7:11; Ps. 68:17; Lk. 2:13; Heb. 12:22; Lk. 20:34-46;
Matt. 22:30; Rev. 5:11.
c. Their knowledge of the mysteries of grace is limited (1 Peter 1:12).
d. Angels are spirits. They cannot be seen with the eyes. They can, however,
take on human form (Heb. 1:14; Mk. 16:5; Heb. 13:2).
e. Angels are finite creatures. They were made by God, and they are His
creatures (Ps. 148:1-2).
f. Angels are personal beings. Gabriel was an angel who came to Daniel (Dan
9:21), Gabriel is also seen in Luke speaking to Zechariah and to Mary (Lk.
1:26). Michael is mentioned in Daniel (Dan 12:1).
g. Angels are powerful, mighty, and possess great strength (Ps. 103:20; 2
Thess. 1:7; Rev. 10:1).

C. Work of angels
1. Angels fulfill many functions in the service of God. They are His agents (the
executors of God’s decrees and judgment). See Gen. 3:24; Matt. 13:39, 41, 49;
Mk. 13:27; 2 Sam. 24:16.
2. They are His messengers, delivering annunciations (Lk. 1:11-20; Matt. 1:20),
warnings (Matt. 2:13), instructions (Matt. 28:2-6; Acts 10:3; Dan. 4:13-17),	
encouragement (Acts 27:23; gen. 28:12), and revelation (Acts 7:53; Gal. 3:19;
Heb. 2:2; Rev. 1:1).
3. They are God’s servants sent forth to minister to “them who shall be heirs of
salvation (Heb. 1:14).
4. They are sent to believers to sustain (Matt. 4:11; 1 Kings 19:5), to preserve
(Gen. 16:7; Rev 7:1), to deliver (Num. 20:16; Ps. 34:7; 91:11; Matt. 26:53), and
to intercede (Zech. 1:12; Rev. 8:3-4).
5. Thus, we may pray to God for aid from His angels; however, we are not to pray
directly to them or to worship them (Col. 2:18; Rev. 22:8-9).

D. Organization among angels
1. CHERUBS (cherubim): appear to be a high rank of angels connected with
God’s retributive and redemptive purposes (Gen. 3:24; Ex. 25:22; Ez. 1).
2. SHERAPHS (seraphim-“burning ones”): appear to aid in showing man his
sinfulness in comparison to the glory and righteousness of God (Is. 6).
3. ANGELS OF THE NATIONS: special guardians of national groups, as Michael
is the “Prince of the Hebrew nation” (Dan. 10:13, 20-21). Michael, aside from
being the “Prince of Israel” is also the archangel and chief of God’s hosts (Jude
9; Dan. 10:13; 12:1; Rev. 12:7). Gabriel is the special messenger of God, one
who bears the most important messages for the kingdom (Dan. 8:16; Lk. 1:19,
26).

II. THE DOCTRINE OF DEMONS
==========================

The study of the origin and operation of Satan and demon spirits.
A. Satan was in heaven as Lucifer
1. He was cast out (Rev. 12:9).
2. One-third of the angels went with him (Rev. 12:4).
3. He rules in the world system as god of this world (2 Cor. 4:4).
4. He has spiritual authority and a hierarchy (Eph. 6:12).

B. Satan and his demons are active today.
1. Going around destroying (1 Pet. 5:8).
2. Are actively accusing the brethren (Rev. 12:10).
3. Cannot read your mind.

C. Jesus conquered Satan (Col. 2:15)
1. Jesus gave us all authority over Satan and evil spirits (Matt. 28:18-20; Mark
16:15-20; Luke 10:19).
2. We must be led by the Holy Spirit to effectively counter evil spirits.
3. Be not ignorant of his devices, lest he get an advantage over you (2 Cor. 2:11).	

D. Names for demon spirits
1. Spirit of infirmity (Luke 13:11).
2. Deaf and dumb spirit (Mark 9:25).
3. Unclean spirit (Matt. 12:43; Mark 1:23; Luke 9:42).
4. Familiar spirit (Lev. 20:27; 2 Kings 23:24; Isa. 8:19).
5. A lying spirit (1 Kings 22:22-23; 2 Chron. 18:21-22).
6. Seducing spirits (1 Tim. 4:1).
7. Foul spirit (Mark 9:25; Rev. 18:2).
8. Jealous spirit (Num. 5:14,30).
9. Spirit of fear (2 Tim. 1:7).
10. Divination (Acts 16:16).

E. How to be protected in the midst of spiritual warfare
1. Put on the spiritual armor of God (Eph. 6:10-18).
a. Breastplate of righteousness.
b. Loins girt about with truth.
c. Feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
d. Helmet of salvation.
e. Shield of faith.
f. Sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.
2. “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints” (Eph. 6:18).
3. Understand that demons have limitations. Although Satan and his demons are very strong, there are definite limitations to their strength. Satan may not test us too severely without God’s permission (Job 1:13, 2:6). Moreover, Satan’s power has been broken by the coming of Jesus Christ. Satan still exercises his powers, but believes, who have Christ’s Spirit, can “resist the devil, and he must flee” from them (James 4:7).
