Lesson 5: The Holy Spirit and the Life of a Believer
====================================================


I. THE HOLY SPIRIT’S WORK IN THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS
=======================================================

A. The Holy Spirit in the Old Testament
---------------------------------------

1. The Spirit of God in creation (Gen. 1:2).
2. The Spirit of God in the creation of man (Gen. 22:7).
3. The Spirit of God and Old Testament men.
	a. He gave them supernatural gifts for the control, function and direction of Israel - Their great leaders , prophets, priests and kings were all anointed of God (1 Sam. 16:12-13).
	b. He gave them supernatural gifts of power like on Samson, Gideon and David (2 Chron. 24:20, Num. 11:25; Ex. 31:3).
	c. There are about 100 direct references to the Spirit of God in the Old Testament, 75 of which describe the Spirit of God influencing men externally (from without) and only 25 times influencing them internally (within).
		1) So, in the Old Testament the Spirit of God comes primarily for Visitation and not Habitation

4. The Spirit of God in relation to the Prophets Lives 

	These were men of the spirit who spoke and acted under the divine direction of the Spirit of God, chosen to represent God to men with His message for their time and age. Under the Spirit of God they elevated religion to it's highest level ever up until the birth of Christ.

5. The Spirit of God was transferred to others.
	a. Elijah and Elisha (2 Kings 2:15)
	b. 1 Sam 16:13-14
	c. Moses and the men (Nu. 11:17, 25-29)

6. The Spirit of God in relation to Religious experience (Psalm 51)

7. The Spirit of God was prophesied for the Future
	a. Isaiah 32:13-17; 44:1-4, 61:1- This was 800 years before the Holy Spirit was sent.
	b. Ezekiel 39:27-29
	c. Joel 2:28-32

8. The Big Picture of the Spirit of God in the Old Testament
	The Spirit's presence among Israel was to oversee the religious and moral life,to guide the affairs of men, history and Israel to the redeemer and to indicate there would be a future age of the Spirit, in which the Holy Spirit would be poured out on all mankind without limitation and without discrimination.

B. The Holy Spirit in the New Testament

	a. The birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:15)

	d. The word comforter means a helper who comes along side of us, who transacts the life of Jesus in us. He would not leave them as orphans, that is to abandon them.

		+++ It would be at least 25 years before His teachings and sayings would be written so they would need to rely on the Holy Spirit.

	e.) In relation to the profitable truths of the Holy Spirit (Jn. 16:13-15):
		1) He is the Spirit of truth

		1) He reproves the world of sin
		2) He reproves the world of righteousness
		3) He reproves the world of Judgment

3. The Book of Acts- (Acts 2- The day of Pentecost and the following chapters where He is mentioned scores of times).

6. The Book of Revelation
	a. The Holy Spirit speaking to the church (Rev. 2 & 3)
	b. Salvation's last call (Rev. 22:17)

C. The Holy Spirit in the life of the believer
----------------------------------------------

1. At salvation we are baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13).
2. After salvation we are filled, baptized in the Holy Spirit (Jn. 7:37-39; Eph. 5:18, Acts 2:4).
	
	a. The Biblical Basis for The Baptism in the Holy Spirit:
		1) The Prophet Joel 2:28-32
		2) The Prophet John The Baptist - Mt. 3:11; Lk. 3:16; Mk 1:8; Jn. 1:33
		3) The Prophet Jesus – Lk. 4:29; Jn. 7:37-39; Acts 1:4,5,8
		4) The Day of Pentecost In Acts 2:1-4; 8:14-17; 9:17; 10:44-48; 19:1-6
		5) The Prophet Peter Acts 2:16-21,33
		6) The Command of the Apostle Paul – Eph. 5:18
		
In each of these accounts there is a common experience evidenced or implied and that is they spoke in tongues, or received a spiritual prayer language. We sense that this is or can be an evidence when one is baptized or filled with the Holy Spirit. We understand if this is not your persuasion, It is surely not the only evidence of being filled or baptized in the Holy Spirit.
