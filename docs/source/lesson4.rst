II. THE TRINITY (FATHER, SON, AND HOLY SPIRIT)
==============================================

The Trinity is the doctrine that God is one God who at the same time subsists in three
Persons: The Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit.

The Holy Trinity, Triune God or the word Trinity does not appear in the Bible, but the
truth and reality of the Trinity (Three-ness) does exist as a clear teaching of the
scriptures.	
 
The belief in the Godhead and the relationship we have with each member of the Godhead gives great reality to our faith and walk as Christians. We must not neglect any member of the Godhead or Trinity. 

Sometimes it seems beyond human understanding but the Trinity is essential to the knowledge and being of God. 

It is our one Great God who exists in three Persons.  

The scriptures teach the plurality of the Godhead- a Holy Trinity composed of God the Father, God the Son and God the Spirit. Each a distinct personality, and yet divinely one God.
	They are *Co-Equal*, *Co-Eternal* and *Co-Cooperative*.

A. They are referred to as God.
-------------------------------
	* The Father is called God – Jn. 6:27; Rom. 1:27; Gal. 1:1
	* Jesus, the Son is called God Jn. 1:1; Rom. 9:5; Titus 2:13; 1 Jn. 5:20
	* The Holy Spirit is called God Acts 5:3-9
	
	As scripture unfolds we see God revealing Himself in three Persons.

B. They have a Relationship with each other and they honor each other. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	There was an activity between the three Persons of the Godhead in which there
	was communion, love and fellowship from eternity past.

	* The Spirit glorifies the Son Jn. 16:14
	* The Son glorifies the Father Jn. 17:4
	* The Father glorifies the Son Jn. 17:5; Acts 2:23
